                    <h1>David Griffith</h1>
                    <p>I am a developer that is passionate about coding and creating things that do not yet exist, but are in demand. I am motivated by learning and using new technologies, but my current primary proficiency set is with C#, Java, C++, Visual Studio, and Unity, especially as applied in algorithms and back-end functionality. If you want to take a look at a few of the projects that I have made (by myself or in a team with others) then head on over to the projects section. Many of them I am still working on, so check back often for updates! If you want to ask any questions, feel free to contact me through the links in my contact page, where you can also find my resume if you are interested in hiring me! I am currently looking for my first full time job in the industry after I get my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and Game Development in September, though I do already have two associate's degrees in the same field. I am ready to relocate anywhere nationwide. I am primarily looking for roles related to game development, preferably with gameplay programming or back-end systems.</p>
